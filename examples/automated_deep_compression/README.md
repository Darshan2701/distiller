# Automated Compression

This sample application will show examples of various methods to automate the DNN compression process.
We start with AMC.

## AMC - AutoML for Model Compression

We thank Prof. Song Han and his [team](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/amc-compressed-models) for their help with certain critical parts of this implementation.  However, all bugs in interpretation and/or implementation are ours ;-).
